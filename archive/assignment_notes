The Ames Housing dataset



1. Feature Categorization

We'll categorize features into two groups:

    Location-related features: Neighborhood, MS Zoning, Lot Config, Street, Alley, Land Slope, Condition1, Condition2

    Property-related features: Overall Qual, Overall Cond, Year Built, Year Remod/Add, Total Bsmt SF, Gr Liv Area, Garage Cars, Full Bath, Fireplaces, etc.


Training models with all features and then another without location features. This way, we can directly measure the drop in model performance when location-related features are removed. 

Step-by-Step Approach

    Full Model

        Train a regression model (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest, or Linear Regression) using all available features.
        Evaluate performance using RMSE, MAE, and R².
        Analyze SHAP values to determine the most influential features.

    Model Without Location Features
        Remove all location-related variables (e.g., Neighborhood, MS Zoning, Condition1, etc.).
        Retrain the model using only property-related features.
        Compare performance metrics with the full model.

    Use K Clustering to disocver clusters in the data

    Impact Analysis
        Compare feature importances between the two models.
        Check if removing location variables significantly affects prediction accuracy.
        Use statistical tests (e.g., paired t-test on errors) to determine if the drop in performance is statistically significant.

IMPORTANT

We are testing **how the model** interprets and utilises location-related data** when predicting house prices

What This Experiment Tells Us

    Impact of Location on Predictions

        If the model with all features significantly outperforms the one without location features, it means location-related variables contribute substantially to price predictions.
        If the performance gap is small, it suggests property characteristics alone are sufficient, and location may have less impact.

    Feature Importance & Interpretation

        SHAP values will show how much location features influence individual predictions.
        Comparing feature importances before and after removing location variables reveals whether the model shifts focus to other features (e.g., square footage, condition) when location is removed.

    Fairness & Realism Considerations

        If location influences too much, it might indicate price biases based on neighborhood rather than home quality.
        If property features alone predict prices well, it suggests that house pricing is more about the house itself than its surroundings.

Real World Implication

1. Real Estate Market Insights

    If location is more important than property features:
        This suggests that buyers prioritize neighborhood factors over home characteristics.
        It reinforces why real estate agents emphasize “location, location, location.”
        It can guide property investors on whether to focus on neighborhood development vs. individual home upgrades.

    If property features are more important:
        It suggests homebuyers and investors care more about home size, quality, and amenities rather than location.
        It could challenge the common belief that neighborhood matters the most in pricing.

2. Housing Affordability & Policy Decisions
    Impact on housing prices & gentrification:
        If location drives prices significantly, this could lead to issues like gentrification, where wealthier buyers push out lower-income residents from desirable areas.
        Cities may need policies to balance development and prevent housing inequalities.

    Fair property taxation & assessments:

        Governments use property valuation models for taxation. If location overpowers other factors, tax policies might be unfairly favoring some neighborhoods over others.
        Policymakers could use findings to improve fair tax assessments.

3. Mortgage & Lending Decisions

    Fair lending & bias detection:
        Banks and mortgage lenders use predictive models for loan approvals. If location dominates the pricing model, it could introduce redlining risks—where loans are denied based on neighborhood rather than financial merit.
        Regulators could use findings to ensure AI-driven mortgage models do not reinforce socioeconomic biases.

    Better risk assessment for banks:
        If property features matter more, lenders might adjust loan criteria to focus more on house quality rather than neighborhood reputation.

4. Urban Planning & Sustainability

    Future city planning:
        If location dominates, city planners might need to invest more in developing underperforming areas to balance housing demand.
        If property features are key, efforts might shift to improving home quality rather than just infrastructure upgrades.

    Sustainability considerations:
        If location drives prices, developers may continue urban sprawl into high-demand areas, increasing environmental impact.
        If property features matter more, eco-friendly housing innovations (e.g., energy-efficient homes) could become a stronger market focus.

5. Homeowners & Buyers' Decision-Making

    For homeowners:
        If location is dominant, homeowners have less control over price appreciation.
        If property features matter more, homeowners can increase value through renovations.

    For buyers:

        Understanding price drivers helps buyers prioritize features vs. location based on long-term goals.
        If location is key, buyers may sacrifice home quality for a better area.
        If property features dominate, they may focus on home upgrades instead of neighborhood prestige.


At its core, this experiment is testing how predictive models interpret and use location-related data—which in turn reflects how algorithms, and by extension, AI-driven decision-making in real estate, learn from and amplify real-world patterns.

WHAT WE ARE REALLY TESTING

    How Machine Learning Models Learn & Prioritize Information

        Does the model rely heavily on location variables, or does it find more value in property attributes?
        Does removing location features force the model to adjust its weighting of other factors?

    Model Dependency on Data Biases

        If the model’s performance drops significantly when removing location, it suggests the dataset contains strong location-based pricing patterns—which may reflect real-world biases.

        If performance remains strong without location, the model is learning that home attributes alone are enough to predict price, suggesting price formation is less about geography.

    AI Transparency & Feature Explainability

        By comparing SHAP values and permutation importance, you’re checking:

            How much the model leans on location.
            How price predictions change when location data is removed.

        This aligns with AI fairness concerns—especially in real estate pricing and lending, where models should be explainable and unbiased.

    Limitations of AI in Complex Human Decisions

        Real estate pricing is not just data-driven—buyers make emotional, social, and practical decisions beyond what's in the dataset.

        By testing what happens whn models lack location data, you see how well (or poorly) AI can generalize house pricing without full context.

Big Picture: Testing AI’s Real-World Decision-Making

It’s about understanding how AI interprets data in decision-making systems.
